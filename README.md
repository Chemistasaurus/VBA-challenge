## VBA
-  Created a macro that contains the following:
  -  Scripts to make a summary table of each ticker, the yearly price change for the stock, the yearly percent change and total stock volume. From this point on,        this will be referred to as the first summary table.
  -  Scripts to add conditional formatting to the yearly change and percent change columns in the first summary table that turned the cell red when the change was       negative and green when the change was positive. 
  -  Scripts to make a second summary table to looped through the first summary table and found the ticker with the highest stock volume for the year, the ticker        with the  greatest percent increase of a stock price in that year, and the ticker with the greatest percent decrease in that year.
-  Modified the scripts to loop through each worksheet in the workbook which each represented a year of stock market data. 

## Conclusion
VBA is a powerful introduction to programming. I was unaware of VBA before I started the bootcamp.
